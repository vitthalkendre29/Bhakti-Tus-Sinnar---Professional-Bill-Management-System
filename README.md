## Core Functionality Breakdown

### **Authentication Module**
- Simple credential validation (admin/password)
- Session state management with localStorage
- Secure logout with form reset
- Auto-redirect based on authentication status

### **Bill Calculation Engine**
```javascript
// Bags Calculation
totalWeight = quantity √ó avgWeight
amount = totalWeight √ó pricePerKg
emptyBagAmount = emptyBagQuantity √ó emptyBagPrice
total = amount + emptyBagAmount

// Vehicle Weight Calculation  
totalWeight = loadedWeight - emptyWeight
amount = totalWeight √ó pricePerKg
emptyBagAmount = emptyBagQuantity √ó emptyBagPrice
total = amount + emptyBagAmount
```

### **Bill Number Generation System**
- Format: `BT + YYMM + 6-digit counter`
- Example: BT2501000001 (January 2025, Bill #1)
- Monthly counter reset for organized tracking
- Automatic increment based on existing bills

### **Data Structure**
```javascript
// Bill Object Structure
{
  id: "timestamp_string",
  billNumber: "BT2501000001",
  customerName: "string",
  customerAddress: "string", 
  customerPhone: "string",
  type: "bag" | "vehicle",
